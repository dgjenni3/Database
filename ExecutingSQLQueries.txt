HOW TO EXECUTE SQL QUERIES IN PYTHON (for selecting from a table):

result = db.engine.execute("YOUR SQL QUERY GOES HERE!").fetchall()

YOU WILL GET A LIST OF TUPLES CONTAINING THE ATTRIBUTES YOU WANT

After executing all the queries you want, commit the changes with:

db.session.commit()

(don't use fetchall when inserting)
