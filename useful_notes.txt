Misc. Helpful Notes

1. Use a redirect (e.g. "return redirect(url_for('url'))") to change URLs
2. Environment variables ARE NOT SAVED across redirects
3. To fix this problem, use the "session" object to store whatever you want in it.
	Example: setting the current username across redirects: "session['CURR_USER'] = 'USERNAME GOES HERE'"

4. url_for takes a FUNCTION NAME as a parameter (input as a string)
